## Who I Am

I'm a curious individual exploring AI, cybersecurity, mental health, wellbeing, and longevity. I write to understand these topics better. Writing forces clarity, and sharing publicly keeps me honest.

I'm not an expert. I'm a learner documenting the process.

## What This Site Is

This is my public notebook. I write these notes for myself first. If they help you too, that's a bonus.

You'll find learning notes, not tutorials. I start with fundamentals and build up. Expect circuits, binary, how computers work, then AI and security concepts. I also write about focus, attention, and maintaining balance in a world designed to distract.

## Why I Write About These Topics

Technology affects everything we do now. I'm concerned about what social media and AI are doing to our ability to focus. We're losing the capacity for deep attention. Notifications pull us away constantly. Algorithms keep us scrolling.

Focus will be one of the most valuable skills in the future. I want to use these technologies responsibly, understand how they work, and know when to step away.

## My Approach

I care about how technology affects mental health. Privacy and security matter, but so do wellbeing and longevity. These areas connect. How we use technology affects how we feel. The habits we build today shape how we age tomorrow.

Technology is a tool, not a lifestyle.

## A Note on Accuracy

You may see mistakes, corrections, and changes in thinking. That's the learning process. If something isn't clear or wrong, let me know. These notes work better as a conversation.
