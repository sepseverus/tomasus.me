## Who I Am

Someone who wants to understand what is coming and how we as human beings will be impacted.

I work in technology. I read history. I think a lot about how to stay grounded while everything around us accelerates.

## What This Site Is

This is my public notebook. I write these notes for myself first. Writing forces me to think clearly. Sharing publicly keeps me accountable.

These are not tutorials. They are overviews of the things I think matter. If they help you too, that's a bonus.

## What I Cover

**Technology from the ground up.** How electricity works, semiconductors, data centers, cloud infrastructure. LLMs, algorithms, and what the frontier labs are building. You need to understand these things to understand what's coming.

**Cybersecurity and its impact.** How attacks work, what's changing, and why it matters for everyone.

**What social media and AI are doing to our brains.** How algorithms keep us scrolling. What that does to our attention, our mental health, and our ability to think clearly.

**Focus as a skill.** I believe focus will be one of the most valuable abilities in the future. We're losing it, and most people don't notice until it's gone.

**History.** Revolutions have happened before. New technologies wiped out entire industries. Looking at how humans reacted to past disruptions helps me think about what's ahead.

## How I Write

I keep things simple. Short sentences. Clear structure. If I can't explain something simply, I probably don't understand it well enough yet.

You won't find jargon here for the sake of sounding smart. The goal is clarity. I'd rather be understood than impressive.

You will see mistakes, corrections, and changes in thinking. That's the point. Learning out loud means showing the process, not just the conclusions.

## Balance

Technology should help us, not consume us. That sounds obvious, but look around.

People check their phones 100 times a day. Kids can't sit through a meal without a screen. Adults doom-scroll for hours and wonder why they feel anxious.

I care about maintaining independence. Using these tools on my terms, not theirs. Knowing when to switch off. Keeping a balance between the digital world and the real one.

Staying sane in the middle of all this is not automatic. It takes intention.
