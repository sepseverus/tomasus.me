I'm a cybersecurity professional who happens to care deeply about mental wellbeing, health, and technology that actually works.

This blog is where those worlds intersect.

## What I write about

**Tech:** Security research, AI developments, tools and systems that solve real problems. From threat hunting to building personal AI infrastructure.

**Wellbeing:** Mental health practices, biohacking experiments, sleep optimization, longevity science. The things that help knowledge workers stay sharp and healthy.

## Why this blog exists

These are topics that matter to me, written from lived experience rather than theory. If they help you too, that's the point.

The writing here is thoughtful, genuine, and unhurried. Think of it as explaining something to a smart friend over coffee, not pitching to an audience.
