I'm writing these notes for myself. If they help you too, that's a bonus.

I want to understand AI, cybersecurity, mental health, wellbeing, and longevity better. Writing forces me to think clearly. Sharing my notes publicly keeps me honest.

This is how I learn.

## Why These Topics?

Life is not only about technologies. But technology affects everything we do now.

I'm concerned about what social media and AI are doing to our mental health. We're losing the ability to focus for long periods. Notifications pull us away constantly. Algorithms feed us content designed to keep us scrolling.

Focus will be one of the most valuable skills in the future. I'm exposed to these technologies daily, and I want to maintain my independence. That means using them responsibly, understanding how they work, and knowing when to step away.

## The Balance

Technology needs context. AI and cybersecurity matter, but so do wellbeing and longevity. I care about mental health as much as I care about learning new frameworks.

These areas connect. How we use technology affects how we feel. Privacy and security impact our peace of mind. The habits we build today shape how we age tomorrow.

## What You'll Find Here

These are learning notes, not tutorials. I'm exploring fundamentals first, then building up. My next post covers how electricity works. That might seem basic, but understanding how electrons move helps you understand everything built on top.

From there, I'll move into circuits, binary, how computers work. Then AI, security concepts, and how to use these technologies without letting them control you.

I'll also write about focus, attention, mental health, and maintaining balance. Technology is a tool, not a lifestyle.

## What to Expect

I hate the word expert. Let's assume I'm not an expert but a curious individual exploring these topics.

You may see mistakes, corrections, and changes in thinking. That's the point.

If something isn't clear, that's on me. If I get something wrong, let me know. These notes work better when they're part of a conversation.

Thanks for being here.
